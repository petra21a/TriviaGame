## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The theme and layout of this app was left up to us.
## Technical Approach
- The challenges to this assignment using an implementing mutiple new concepts at the same time including:
  - jQuery
  - DOM Listeners
  - Time manipulation with SetInterval and SetTimeout
- A key learning from this exercise was learning how asyncronously timers and listeners work together!
- During this portion of the class we were also introduced to objects and scoping, so I challenged myself in this assginment to encapsulate the entire game in a single object. This proved both educational and challenging!
- I chose a theme near to my interests in Geology and Travel - Natural Wonder's of the World. I did some initial scoping to see if I could utilitze a "Carmen Sandiago" theme, but it didn't quite jive with the overall theme. Instead I opted to make this focused on the stunning pictures out on the web of these natural wonders to hopefully spark some passion for visiting them. Enjoy!
